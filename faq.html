            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <div>
                <b>What is a Hackathon?</b><p>A hackathon is a coding marathon - it's like a real-time programming fair where students develop an idea and bring it to life through code. A project could be a game, website, app, robot, Arduino project, whatever! If you enjoy programming or technology in general, hackathons are great places to meet friendly, like-minded people.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Do I need to know how to code?</b><p>No, you don't! Even if you aren't able to code beforehand, you can attend workshops, learn some code, and still submit a project.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>When and where is QuHacks?</b><p>QuHacks will take place on December 8th, 2018, from 9 am - 6 pm at Towson University YR Building</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Who can attend?</b><p>Participation is limited to students currently enrolled in high school and middle school students above the age of 13. If you have already graduated high school but would still like to attend the event, please consider volunteering or mentoring for the event! Send us an email at <a href="mailto:freddy@quhacks.tech">freddy@quhacks.tech</a> for more information on contributing to QuHacks.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>What if I don't have a team?</b><p>No problem! Many participants arrive without a team, and you can meet and work with new people. You can also choose to work alone. The limit is 4 people per team.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>What can I make?</b><p>TBD</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>How much does QuHacks cost?</b><p>Nothing! We'll be providing meals, snacks, and swag completely free of charge, thanks to our awesome sponsors. If you're interested in becoming a sponsor, please email us at <a href="mailto:freddy@quhacks.tech">freddy@quhacks.tech</a></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>What should I bring?</b><p>We recommend that you bring a laptop (One per team is fine). Laptops aren't required, but it won't be easy to code on lined paper.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Can I use past projects?</b><p>Anyone caught working on past projects will be forced to sit in the corner and wear the dunce hat. Seriously though, don't be that one guy.</p></div>

            <div>
                <b>What if I don't have friends?</b><p>If you are attending alone, don't worry! We can help you form a group based on your interests or you can fly solo, although working with a team is encouraged.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Who's Freddy?</b><p>At some point, Freddy had a cheesy description here. However, we can't seem to decide what Freddy is, so we'll just say he's that one duck you keep seeing around incomplete parts of this website.</p>
